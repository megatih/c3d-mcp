# Cheetah3D Scripting Gotchas (targeting 8.x)

The things the official docs leave out, get wrong, or no longer describe correctly. This page is for anyone (human or AI) writing Cheetah3D JavaScript for **8.x**.

**Sources and conventions**

- Forum citations look like [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/). Each one links to the archived thread (`forum/threads/<id>-*.md`). The thread's dates are in `catalog/forum-threads.json`.
- "Docs" means the official 8.1.1 reference in `reference/api/*.md`. A link like [docs: Base](../reference/api/Base.md) points to a page there.
- "Example" means a script bundled with 8.1.1 in `examples/official/`, linked like [ex: Parameter Info.js](../examples/official/Macro/Parameter%20Info.js). These are the best evidence of what still works in 8.x.
- **(pre-7; unverified in 8.x)**: the claim comes only from threads that end before Cheetah3D 7 (about 2016) and nothing newer confirms it.
- **DOCS-CONFLICT**: the forum or an example contradicts the 8.1.1 reference.
- **DOCS-GAP**: the forum or an example relies on behaviour or API that the reference does not document.
- **[verify]**: the claim is on the "Verify in app" list at the end.

## 1. Script types and installation

- **The folder decides the script type, not the file contents.** User scripts live in `~/Library/Application Support/Cheetah3D/Scripts/<Type>/`. The types are `Macro`, `Tool`, `Polygonobj`, `Splineobj`, `Particle` and `Tag`. The docs write `scripts` in lowercase; the forum and examples write `Scripts`. The macOS filesystem is case-insensitive, so both work. [docs: ExecuteScript](../reference/ExecuteScript.md) [#808](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/808/) [#1294](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1294/) [#2627](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2627/) [#5752](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5752/) [#6652](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6652/) [#7522](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7522/) [#8307](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8307/) [#9025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9025/)
- **A script in the wrong folder fails in confusing ways.** Possible symptoms:
  - `Object.setParameter() couldn't find parameter called name` or `... normalType`, because the host object is a different kind [#970](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/970/) [#4334](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4334/) [#10257](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10257/)
  - `'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'core.addParticle()')`: a Particle script in Polygonobj gets a PolyCore [#7356](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7356/)
  - the script silently does nothing: a Macro in Tool, or a main() script anywhere other than Macro [#989](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/989/) [#2565](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2565/) [#6373](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6373/)
  - a "Polygon script" object appears instead of a tool, or the app freezes or crashes [#1099](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1099/) [#1298](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1298/) [#6367](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6367/) [#12264](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12264/) [#10416](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10416/)
  - JS errors in a spline or particle script [#1284](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1284/) [#1456](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1456/) [#7347](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7347/) [#10106](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10106/)

  When debugging, check the folder first.
- **Only `.js` files are listed.** Unzip `*.js.zip` downloads. [#808](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/808/) [#1448](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1448/)
- **New script files need a menu refresh.** Use the "Update Scripts Menu" / "Update menu" item at the bottom of the Script menu (5.x+), or relaunch. Edits to a script that is already listed are picked up without a restart; you may need to re-pick it from the menu. The docs only say "restart Cheetah3D" (DOCS-GAP). [#812](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/812/) [#1145](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1145/) [#1294](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1294/) [#6373](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6373/) [docs: ExecuteScript](../reference/ExecuteScript.md)
- **Subfolders inside a type folder are fine. A new top-level folder under `Scripts/` is not shown in the menus.** You can use that to hold shared library code: see `Scripts/Library` in §7. [#9025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9025/) [#12183](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12183/)
- **Scenes reference script objects and tags by script file name.** If you rename the `.js` file (even spaces to underscores), saved `.jas` files no longer find it and the stored parameter values are lost. Keep filenames stable across versions. [#6905](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6905/)
- **Telling the type from the source** (heuristic from *Learn 3D with Cheetah 3D* (Tonio Loewald)):
  - `main(doc)` means Macro.
  - `buildObject` plus `addParticle` means Particle.
  - `buildObject` plus `move/line/curve` means Splineobj.
  - `buildObject` with neither means Polygonobj.
  - Only `buildUI`, maybe with `performExpression`, means Tag.
  - `buildUI` plus a button callback and no `buildObject` means Tool.

  See `reference/book-ch17.8-scripts.md`.
- **Only Tool scripts get a parameter panel**, and it is shown in the **Tool** tab of the properties panel. If your layout has no Tool tab, the tool seems to do nothing. Macros run immediately and have no UI. [#2110](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2110/) [#10843](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10843/) [#12598](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12598/)
- **Tool parameter values reset every time the tool is invoked from the menu.** The tool-history hotkeys and the factory icon keep values. [#2280](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2280/)
- **You cannot create a working script object from another script.** `doc.addObject(SCRIPTSPLINE)` followed by `setParameter("scriptName", path)` gives an object with no parameters (Martin, 7b19). There was also no documented way to set which script a script tag created this way runs. [#12214](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12214/) [#11084](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11084/)
- **Hotkeys:** bind a script through macOS System Settings › Keyboard › App Shortcuts using the exact menu title (the file name), or through Cheetah3D's own shortcut settings. External automation (JXA/System Events) can then trigger macros. [#2280](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2280/) [#3342](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3342/) [#6373](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6373/) [#11774](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11774/)
- **No native plug-ins and no loading of unsigned external code** (Mac App Store sandbox, 2012). Helper executables run through `OS.system` work. On macOS 10.12+, Gatekeeper must be allowed to run a bundled helper. [#9039](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9039/) [#12343](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12343/)
- **The bundled examples start with an optional header comment**, `//C3D_VERSION_REQUIREMENT 7.0.0`, which presumably gates loading on older versions. DOCS-GAP. [ex: Particle Image.js](../examples/official/Particle/Particle%20Image.js)

## 2. Entry points and lifecycle

- **Hook functions by type.** Only these names are called; others are ignored.

  | Type | Hooks |
  |---|---|
  | Macro | `main(doc)` |
  | Tool | `buildUI(tool)`, plus button callbacks `fn(tool)` |
  | Polygonobj / Splineobj / Particle | `buildUI(obj)` once when the object is created, and `buildObject(obj)` on every rebuild |
  | Tag | `buildUI(tag)`, plus `performExpression(tag)` (7.0+) |

  `apply(tag)`, `buildObject(tag)` and `applyParameters(tag)` are **not** called on tags. [#989](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/989/) [#1577](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1577/) [#4058](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4058/) [#10432](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10432/) [#13505](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/13505/) [ex: CircleExpression.js](../examples/official/Tag/CircleExpression.js)
- **Expression tags (`performExpression`) are 7.0+ and missing from the docs** (DOCS-GAP: [docs: Tag](../reference/api/Tag.md) never mentions the hook).
  - Before 7, tag scripts could only add parameters: Martin in 2006 and again in May 2014. [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/) [#10432](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10432/)
  - By convention the first parameter is an Int named `priority` (`addParameterInt("priority",10,0,1000,true,true)`), which evidently sets evaluation order.
  - Inside the hook, use `tag.owner()` and `tag.document().animationTime()`.
  - Write with `owner.setParameter(name, v, false)`.

  [#5752](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5752/) [#13505](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/13505/) [ex: CircleExpression.js](../examples/official/Tag/CircleExpression.js)
- **The core is empty at the start of each `buildObject`.** Every official generator appends to `obj.core()` with no clearing step, so treat `buildObject` as "regenerate from scratch" (inferred from the examples). [ex: GrapherUV.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/GrapherUV.js) [ex: Sinecircle.js](../examples/official/Splineobj/Sinecircle.js) [ex: Particle Menger.js](../examples/official/Particle/Particle%20Menger.js)
- **Calling `setParameter()` inside `buildObject()` causes an infinite rebuild loop.** This applies to the script object itself and to other objects or tags. It may only show up during final or movie rendering, after several good frames.
  - Always pass `false` as the third argument there.
  - Never write the script object's own parameters from `buildObject`.

  [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/) [#7885](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7885/) [#8338](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8338/) [#8739](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8739/)
- **Set `obj.setCreatorObj(true)` in `buildUI` if the script reads its children.** Otherwise `buildObject` is not re-run when a child changes (for example a spline being edited). [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/) [#1284](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1284/) [#1647](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1647/) [#1939](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1939/)
- **`buildObject` runs at unpredictable times**: viewport navigation, app re-activation, scene rebuilds, and every render. Anything unseeded, such as `Math.random()`, changes the shape: the official Grassy Knoll example does exactly this. Use a seeded PRNG (see patterns) or cache random values and only regenerate them from a button. [#970](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/970/) [#1294](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1294/) [#8033](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8033/) [#13601](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/13601/) [ex: Grassy Knoll.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/Grassy%20Knoll.js)
- **A script object only rebuilds during playback or rendering if one of its own parameters or transforms changes.** For simulations or time-driven output, add a `time`/`frame`/`timer` parameter and keyframe it (0 at the first frame, a large value at the last). Moving children, linked objects or parent-constrained children may **not** trigger a rebuild. [#713](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/713/) [#3350](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3350/) [#4334](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4334/) [#7885](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7885/) [#9461](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9461/) [#8025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8025/) [#9251](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9251/) [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/)
- **Calling `obj.update()` on a script object re-runs its `buildObject`.** Script objects cannot read each other's JS globals; pass data through parameters or temp files. JS globals persist between `buildObject` calls of one script (the examples keep state in globals). [#3377](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3377/) [ex: Particle Menger.js](../examples/official/Particle/Particle%20Menger.js) [verify]
- **Children of a Polygonobj/Splineobj script are treated as inputs, not rendered output.** Put visible geometry outside the script hierarchy, or generate it in `buildObject`. [#2262](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2262/) [#9251](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9251/)
- **Order matters at render time.** A script object that drives other objects must sit **above** them in the Object Browser. [#8338](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8338/)
- **Creating scene objects from inside `buildObject` is risky.** `document().addObject()` inside `buildObject` crashed in 2006 (3.x) [#1072](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1072/). A 2024 script does it safely by creating children **once** (`if (obj.childCount()==0)`) and then only updating their parameters with `child.update()` [#14381](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/14381/). Prefer Macros or Tools for creating objects.
- **Long loops block the whole UI.** Hooks run synchronously on the main thread: no redraw, no progress bar, no background execution, and minutes-long beachballs on dense meshes. [#3350](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3350/) [#3377](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3377/) [#7079](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7079/) [#10416](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10416/)
- **Scripts cannot react to selection changes or detect modifier keys**, and cannot attach to the document itself. Tag scripts can attach to any object, including cameras and folders. [#11014](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11014/) [#9290](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9290/)
- **Version-specific crashes (4.3, fixed in the next release):**
  - `tool.document().animationEnd()` inside a Tool's `buildUI` crashed on first open.
  - `print()` in a Tool's `buildUI` printed nothing the first time.

  (pre-7; unverified in 8.x) [#2375](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2375/)

## 3. Parameters

- **Every `addParameter*` call must receive all of its documented arguments**, including the trailing booleans. Omitting them can **crash** Cheetah3D rather than throw: `addParameterBool("x", true)` crashed 7.3.3, 7.5.2 and 8.0b3.
  - Note: the official Menger.js calls `addParameterBool(name, init, min, max)` with 4 of 6 arguments, so some short forms survive. Do not rely on that. [verify]

  [#11084](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11084/) [#14327](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/14327/) [ex: Menger.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/Menger.js)
- **`addParameterBool` really does take `(name, init, min, max, animate, build)`**, with boolean min and max. That looks odd, but it is not a doc typo. Pass `false, true` for min and max. [#1326](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1326/) [#14327](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/14327/) [docs: Base](../reference/api/Base.md)
- **Only call `addParameter*` inside `buildUI()`** (docs). Calling `buildUI()` yourself from a Macro still crashed in 2015. Macros cannot add editable parameters to arbitrary objects. [#11084](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11084/) [docs: Base](../reference/api/Base.md)
- **The parameter name is also the UI label, and it is case-sensitive.** For example, a Text spline uses `"text"`, not `"Text"`. [#1577](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1577/) [#13505](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/13505/)
- **Reserved and colliding names: do not reuse built-in parameter names for your own parameters.** Script objects already carry these, as seen in parameter dumps:
  - `name`, `scriptName`, `locked`, `position`, `rotation`, `scale`, `shear`, `pivot`, `prefrot`, `postrot`, `prerot`, `rotorder`, `order`
  - `editorActive`, `renderActive`, `editorShading`, `displayType`
  - `seed` on particle objects
  - a hidden `type`

  A parameter named **`type`** made the object vanish after save and reopen. [#1294](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1294/) [#10025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10025/) (book)
- **Exception: `normalType` and `normalAngle` on polygon scripts.** The 8.x GrapherUV example deliberately declares parameters named `normalType` (selector flat/phong/constraint) and `normalAngle`, then calls `setParameter("normalType",1)`. Re-declaring those names is how a polygon script exposes the host's smoothing controls. Old forum code calls `setParameter("normalType"/"normalAngle", ...)` without declaring them. [#812](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/812/) [#4442](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4442/) [#10572](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10572/) [#13746](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/13746/) [ex: GrapherUV.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/GrapherUV.js) [verify]
- **Parameter names containing a dot broke in 7 beta 18** (fixed in b19). Avoid dots anyway: `.tex` is a real suffix, see the texture bullet below. [#8338](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8338/)
- **Parameter names must be unique within one script.** Two selectors with the same name share state. [#10025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10025/)
- **The third argument of `setParameter(name, value, update)`**: `false` suppresses the scene-graph update. Use it in `buildObject` and `performExpression`, and when writing from one object to another. The overload was added in 3.2 and has been reliable since 3.3. With `true` or omitted, the scene updates and the material preview refreshes, although the color well might not. [#574](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/574/) [#1055](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1055/) [#5752](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5752/) [#7885](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7885/) [#8739](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8739/) [ex: CircleExpression.js](../examples/official/Tag/CircleExpression.js) [docs: Base](../reference/api/Base.md)
- **Selectors:**
  - `getParameter` on a selector returns the selected **index**. Wrap it in `parseInt()` before using it in a `switch`.
  - `setParameter(name, index)` sets it.
  - Option labels go through Cheetah3D's `Localizable.strings`, so `"point"` may display as "Points".
  - A selector with a very long option list was suspected of crashing (Leopard era).

  [#1145](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1145/) [#4058](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4058/) [#6801](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6801/) [#10025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10025/) [ex: GrapherUV.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/GrapherUV.js)
- **Defaults.** Script objects have no UI for user defaults. Set initial values in `buildUI` *after* adding the parameters, for example `obj.setParameter("name","My Thing")` or `obj.setParameter("connect", true)`. Min and max limits come only from the `addParameter*` arguments; to raise a limit, edit the script. [#10603](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10603/) [#664](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/664/) [ex: GrapherUV.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/GrapherUV.js)
- **Button callbacks** are given by name as a string: `addParameterButton(label, buttonTitle, "fnName")` calls the global `fnName(obj)`. [#989](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/989/) [#1801](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1801/) [#3377](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3377/) [ex: Scale Take.js](../examples/official/Tool/Scale%20Take.js)
- **A Tool text field being edited is not committed until it loses focus.** Clicking a button straight after typing uses the old value. [#6600](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6600/) [#1326](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1326/)
- **`getParameter` on a name the object lacks throws.** The error is "couldn't find parameter called X". Guard by checking `obj.parameterInfo()` (an array of `[name, typeString]`) or `obj.parameterWithName(name)` first. [#3610](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3610/) [#4374](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4374/)
- **Discover names with introspection, not the docs.**
  - Use `parameterInfo()`, or `parameterCount()`/`parameterAtIndex(i).name()`/`.type()`.
  - The bundled Macro `Parameter Info.js` prints them.
  - Parameter names change between versions: light parameters changed in 3.1→3.2 and 3.4→3.5, and material parameters in 5.0.

  [#626](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/626/) [#1055](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1055/) [#5550](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5550/) [#7671](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7671/) [#9038](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9038/) [#9627](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9627/) [ex: Parameter Info.js](../examples/official/Macro/Parameter%20Info.js)
- **When dumping, skip `getParameter` on `Link`-type entries,** or print them specially. `print()` needs strings (§10). [#7187](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7187/) [#8220](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8220/)
- **Link parameters.** `addParameterLink(name, build)` gives an object picker; `getParameter(name)` returns the linked **object** (or null). Links are a cleaner input than relying on child order.
  - A Link to animated particles does not trigger a rebuild when they move.

## 4. Geometry: PolyCore, SplineCore, ParticleCore

- **Accessors return copies.** `core.vertex(i)` returns a copy, so `core.vertex(i).add(v)` changes nothing. Write it back: `core.setVertex(i, core.vertex(i).add(v))`. The same applies to `getParameter("position")` and the like: change the value, then call `setParameter`. [#3528](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3528/) [#1226](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1226/) [ex: RotateObject.js](../examples/official/Macro/RotateObject.js)
- **Use the return values of Vec3D math.** Treat `add/sub/multiply/cross` as returning new vectors (as the examples do); only `set()` is documented as changing the vector in place. [verify] [ex: Particle Menger.js](../examples/official/Particle/Particle%20Menger.js)
- **`core()` and `modCore()` are different.**
  - `core()` is the editable base mesh; it is empty (vertexCount 0) for creators and folders.
  - `modCore()` is the mesh after modifiers, for reading.
  - **Neither includes the object transform.** For world space, multiply by `obj.obj2WorldMatrix()`. For a child's geometry relative to the script object, use the child's `objMatrix()`.
  - Child or parent scaling is not reflected in `getParameter("scale")`.

- **`activeCamera()` has no setter.** Set `activeCamera` to 0 on the old camera and 1 on the new one, then call `update()` on both. The Object Browser may not refresh. [#4856](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4856/)
- **Tag type 102 is the material ("shader") tag (`SHADERTAG`).** It holds no material properties; get the material with `doc.materialAtIndex(tag.linkedToMaterial())`, which the 8.x Simple ASCII Export confirms. Around 5.0 this briefly broke, and `tag.getParameter("material")` (a Link) was the workaround. [#2183](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2183/) [#3610](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3610/) [#7187](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/7187/) [#3376](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3376/) [ex: Simple ASCII Export.js](../examples/official/Macro/Simple%20ASCII%20Export.js)
- **Assign a material**: `var t = obj.addTagOfType(SHADERTAG); t.setParameter("material", mat);`. This works since roughly 6.x; in 2008–2010 there was no way. [#8015](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8015/) [#3376](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3376/) [#6604](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6604/) [#1607](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1607/) [verify]
- **Materials are node-based since 5.0.**
  - Old flat parameters (`colorColor`, `colorTex`, `specTex`, `transColor`, …) stopped working in 5.0.
  - Read-only shortcuts remain: `color()`, `colorMap()`, `emission()`, `shininess()`.
  - To set a property, set it on a node, for example `mat.nodeAtIndex(0).setParameter("diffColor", new Vec4D(r,g,b,1))`.
  - The node API (`nodeCount/nodeAtIndex/rootNode/addNodeOfType/addConnection`) appeared in **6.2.1**; older versions throw `'undefined' is not a function`.

- **v7 removed the hidden per-object icon tag.** In 6.x and earlier every object's `tagAtIndex(0)` was a dummy Mode-like tag (type 103) carrying `editorActive/renderActive/editorShading`. In 7+, every tag index shifted by one, and `tagAtIndex(0)` is whatever tag the user added first.
  - Look tags up by type (`tagOfType(T)`), never by index.

- **Rotation component mapping.** `rotation` is a Vec3D of **heading, pitch, bank** in degrees, and `new Vec3D(h, p, b)` takes them in that order (`.x/.h`, `.y/.p`, `.z/.b`). Heading turns the object around **Y**: the official RotateObject.js increments `.h` to "rotate around the Y axis". By the usual HPB convention pitch is around X and bank around Z [verify]. [ex: RotateObject.js](../examples/official/Macro/RotateObject.js)
- **Additive expression tags: don't read back what you write.** If `performExpression` reads `owner.getParameter("rotation")` and writes back `rotation + offset`, the offset builds up on every evaluation. Take the base from somewhere the expression doesn't write:
  - `owner.getParameter("rotation", t)` when the parameter is keyframed. The documented time overload should evaluate the F-curve [verify].
  - Otherwise a base value stored in a parameter on the tag. See patterns A3b and [ex: Wobble.js](../examples/generated/Wobble.js).
- **What a tag script can do is under-documented.** Buttons in a tag's UI, writing the tag's own parameters from `performExpression` (pass `false`), and `recordParametersForUndo` from a tag are all unconfirmed [verify].
- **Undo for edits to several objects (unconfirmed).** Calling `recordParametersForUndo()` on each object before `setParameter` in a single Tool button press makes each edit undoable. Whether they merge into one Undo step is unknown [verify]. [#10282](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10282/)
- **Where scripts appear.** The Script menu mirrors the `Scripts/` folders: Tools › Script › Macro/Tool/… For Tool scripts the UI appears in the **Tool** tab. Script objects (Polygonobj/Splineobj/Particle) are created from the same menu and have their parameters in the object's properties. Script tags are added from the same menu, or the tag menu, with the target object selected [verify exact menu for tags].

## 6. Animation

- **All API time is in seconds, not frames.** This covers `setAnimPosition`, `animPosition()`, `animationEnd()`, `FCurveKey.time` and `valueAtTime`. There is **no frame-rate API** (2012), so ask the user for fps as a parameter (`frame/fps`). [#9041](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9041/) [#8696](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8696/) [#4366](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4366/) [#2110](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2110/) [#1946](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1946/)
- **Current time:**
  - `doc.animPosition()` (6.0+; it is absent in 5.8).
  - The 8.x example uses `doc.animationTime()`, which is **undocumented** (DOCS-GAP).
  - Save the position and restore it after stepping time.
  - One 2012 sample passes an argument to `animPosition(t)`, contrary to the docs.

- **Keyframing goes through Parameter → TakeNode → FCurve → FCurveKey (6.0+).**
  1. `param = obj.parameterWithName("scale")`.
  2. `node = param.takeNodeWithName(doc.currentTake().name) || param.addTakeNode(doc.currentTake().name)`.
  3. `curve = node.fCurveAtIndex(i)`: Vec3D gives curves 0/1/2 for x/y/z, and a Float gives one curve.
  4. Build `new FCurveKey()`, set `time` (seconds), `value`, `left_type/right_type`, `left_time/left_value/right_time/right_value`, then `curve.addKey(k)`.
  5. **Always call `curve.update()`** afterwards.

- **Tangent handles are *relative* to the key**, so `left_time` is negative. Interpolation constants: `SOFT_INTERPOL`, `LINEAR_INTERPOL`, `SPLINE_INTERPOL`, `FLAT_INTERPOL` (the forum sample misspells LINEAR as `LINER`). A 2014 update changed SOFT handling, so keys came out LINEAR until a script was fixed.

- **`takeNodeWithName()` returns null when the parameter isn't animated in that take.** Use `take.name`: a **property**, not a method. `valueAtTime(t)` evaluates a curve (one forum sample passes a second argument).

## 7. Files, OS, shell, libraries

- **File paths must be absolute.** `new File("~/x")` does not expand `~`; only the shell does that. [#2247](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2247/)
- **`File.mkDir()` deletes any existing file or folder at that path without warning** (docs). Check `exist()` first. [docs: File](../reference/api/File.md) [#1161](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1161/)
- **Reading files:**
  - Text: open with `f.open(READ_MODE)`, check `f.isOpen()`, then read `f.read(f.size())`, or loop `f.readln()` until it returns **-1** (`EOF`; undocumented). Then `f.close()`.
  - `new File(p).exist()` returns a boolean.
  - Binary: `open(READ_MODE, LITTLE_ENDIAN|BIG_ENDIAN)`. The docs misspell these as `BIG_ENDIAM`/`LITTLE_ENDIA`.
  - `readInt()` is used successfully but undocumented; the documented readers are `readShort/readUInt/readFloat`.

- **Save panels:** `OS.runSavePanel(ext)` returns a full path or **null**, and `runSavePanel()` with no argument is allowed. Then `new File(path).directory()` and `.lastPathComponent()` split the path.

- **Include through indirect eval:** `var geval = eval; geval(src);`.
  - A direct `eval(src)` inside a function defines things only in local scope; it was confirmed not to work on 7.0.18. One user says direct eval worked for them.
  - Put the library in `Scripts/Library/` (not shown in menus) and wrap it in a namespace object.

- **Finding your files:**
  - `obj.scriptPath()` / `tool.scriptPath()` give the running script's path (Base method). Derive the home folder or the Scripts folder from it with string manipulation.

## 8. Rendering

- **`doc.render()` and `doc.render(path)` are synchronous.** They block until the render finishes and show no progress. Call them on the **instance** (`doc.render()`, not `Document.render()`). You can call them repeatedly in one macro. [#1055](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1055/) [#2262](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2262/) [#5998](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5998/) [#11774](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11774/) [ex: RotateObject.js](../examples/official/Macro/RotateObject.js) [ex: QTVR Helper.js](../examples/official/Macro/QTVR%20Helper.js)
- **The output format comes from the file extension**: the examples use `.tiff` and the forum uses `.jpg`. [#2262](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2262/) [ex: QTVR Helper.js](../examples/official/Macro/QTVR%20Helper.js) [verify]
- **Since v7, render resolution lives on the renderer, not the camera.** Use `doc.currentRenderer().setParameter("resolution", new Vec2D(w,h))`; the camera's `resolutionX/Y` are legacy. Renderers are listed with `rendererCount()/rendererAtIndex(i)` and switched with `setCurrentRenderer(i)`. [#10025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10025/) [docs: Document](../reference/api/Document.md)
- **v7 replaced the DOF tag with camera properties** (focus distance, "Focus on Object"). The old DOF tag (`DOFTAG`, `focalDistance`) no longer drives DOF. [#808](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/808/) [#8710](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8710/) [#8739](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8739/)
- **Before rendering after joint or skin changes, call `update()` on every object**, children first from the root. Skinned meshes don't re-evaluate on their own. [#5998](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5998/)
- **Update loops caused by `setParameter` in `buildObject` often appear only at render time.** See §2. [#8739](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8739/) [#8338](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8338/)
- **For hair-like generated meshes, turn off "visible in radiosity"** to avoid dark artifacts. [#4777](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4777/)
- **Field-of-view math:** angle of view = 2·atan(1 / (2·focalLength)), with image size 1.0 on the larger dimension (podperson). [#8710](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8710/)

## 9. Undo

- **Undo for script edits exists from 6.0.** Docs say these work only in Tool scripts.
  - Call `obj.recordGeometryForUndo()` *before* editing a mesh or spline.
  - Call `obj.recordParametersForUndo()` *before* `setParameter`.

  Without them, edits bypass Undo and don't mark the document dirty. [#8848](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8848/) [#10282](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10282/) [#14324](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/14324/) [#14327](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/14327/) [docs: Base](../reference/api/Base.md)
- **Before 6.0, Undo after a geometry-editing script could crash** (`-[MWMnGon undoRecordedArrays]`). 5.8 changed undo in a way that forced scripts to disable their own undo. (pre-7; unverified in 8.x) [#3792](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3792/) [#8024](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8024/) [#8878](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8878/) [#8884](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8884/) [#9892](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/9892/) [#2565](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2565/)
- **For portable code, feature-detect:** `if (obj.recordGeometryForUndo) obj.recordGeometryForUndo();`. Calling it on 5.8 throws `'undefined' is not a function`. [#8848](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8848/)
- **Redraw lock.** If a script throws after `doc.retainRedrawLock()`, the UI stays frozen. Release it in `try/finally`. To recover, run a macro that calls `doc.releaseRedrawLock(); doc.redrawAll();`. [#1422](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1422/) [docs: Document](../reference/api/Document.md)

## 10. Debugging and crashes

- **`print()` goes to the Console panel, which is hidden by default.** Add it by right-clicking any panel header. There is no REPL and no action recorder. [#2247](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2247/) [#3610](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/3610/) [#8514](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8514/) [#12807](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12807/) (book)
- **`print()` only handles strings.**
  - `print(false)` threw `'false' is not a function`.
  - `print(vec)` prints `[object CallBackObject]`.

  Concatenate with `""` and print vector fields yourself. [#10415](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10415/) [#12807](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12807/) [#8220](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/8220/)
- **Native API objects need `new`.** Calling `Vec4D(...)` without `new` crashed the app. `new Vec2D()` and `new Vec4D(0.0)` (fewer arguments) work in examples. [#1055](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1055/) [ex: GrapherUV.js](../examples/official/Polygonobj/GrapherUV.js) [ex: Particle Image.js](../examples/official/Particle/Particle%20Image.js)
- **Known native bugs:**
  - `Vec3D.dot()` returned a vector instead of a Number; fixed in 6.3.2.
  - `Vec4D.isEqual()` threw "Wrong number or type of arguments" in 2015; compare components manually.

  [#6604](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/6604/) [#10731](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10731/) [#11075](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/11075/) [verify]
- **Introspection.** `for…in` over native objects lists their methods in 5.x+ (podperson's Object Info dumps); in 2007 it did not. `instanceof` fails on native classes; use `typeof x.method=="function"`. [#2183](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/2183/) [#5550](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5550/) [#10025](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10025/) [#10415](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10415/) [#4810](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/4810/)
- **Common error strings:**
  - `Can't find variable: X`: an undefined helper, or a removed constant such as `SPOTLIGHT`.
  - `SyntaxError: illegal character` at line 1: full-width or multibyte whitespace was pasted in.
  - A crash in `-[MWMSFEngine loadScript]` (CFStringGetLength null): the script file is unreadable or corrupt (for example a bad encoding).

  [#1405](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1405/) [#5550](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/5550/) [#1577](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/1577/) [#10731](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10731/)
- **Common crash causes:**
  - missing `addParameter*` arguments (§3)
  - `new` omitted on native constructors
  - nonexistent vertex indices or malformed polygons (§4)
  - a script in the wrong type folder (§1)
  - Undo after non-recorded edits (pre-6)
  - `addObject` inside `buildObject` (§2)

| 6.3.2 | `Vec3D.dot()` fixed | [#10731](https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/10731/) |
| 7.0 | Dummy icon tag removed, so **tag indices shift by −1**. Render resolution moved to renderer. DOF tag replaced by camera DOF. Expression tags (`performExpression`, `animationTime()`). Texture objects via `"param.tex"` (examples from 2016). Dots in param names broke in b18 (fixed b19). `isCeatorObj` typo fixed in b20.

## Verify in app (8.1.1)

These are the highest-impact claims. Each should become a small test macro.

1. **Light constants:**
   - Does `typeof LIGHT` give a number, and do `typeof SPOTLIGHT`, `POINTLIGHT`, `DISTANTLIGHT` and `AREALIGHT` give `"undefined"`?
   - What are the 8.x `lightType` values for point, spot, distant, area and sky?
   - Does `doc.addObject(POINTLIGHT)` work?
2. **`selectedObject()` with nothing selected:** does it return the root (`owner()==null`) rather than null?
3. **Missing `addParameter*` arguments:** does `addParameterBool(name, init)` with 2 arguments still crash 8.1.1? Is the 4-argument form in official Menger.js safe?
4. **`setParameter` in `buildObject`:** does calling it without `false` still loop? Does `false` fully prevent the loop, including during a movie render?
5. **UVs:** does `addIndexPolygon(n, idx, Vec4D[])`, the documented overload, work, or does it still throw "Wrong elemet in uv array"? Does `uvCoord()` still return Vec4D with z,w = UV2?
6. **Indirect vs direct eval:** does `eval(src)` inside a function leak definitions globally in 8.x, or is `var geval=eval` still required? Is `scriptPath()` available on the Document passed to a Macro's `main(doc)`?
7. **Tag indices and visibility flags:** in 8.x, is `editorActive/renderActive/editorShading` a parameter of the object itself? What is `tagAtIndex(0)` on a fresh object? Is `tagCount()` 0?
8. **Material assignment:** does `addMaterial("Material", name)` + `addTagOfType(SHADERTAG)` + `tag.setParameter("material", mat)` render the material? Does setting `"diffColor"` on `nodeAtIndex(0)` or on `rootNode()` change the colour, and which node is the shader?
9. **FCurve keyframing:**
   - Do keys built with `new FCurveKey()` + `addKey` + `update()` appear in the timeline?
   - Are `left_time/right_time` relative?
   - Does `keyAtIndex()` return a copy?
   - Does `setAnimPosition` + `setParameter` still create no keys?
10. **Time APIs:** do both `doc.animPosition()` and the undocumented `doc.animationTime()` exist, and do they agree? Is there still no frame-rate parameter (check `doc.parameterInfo` if Document is a Base, and the renderer's parameters)?
11. **Expression tags:** is `performExpression(tag)` called on every frame and during render? Does the `priority` parameter control order?
12. **Copy semantics:** do `core.vertex(i).add(v)`, `Vec3D.add()` and the result of `getParameter("position")` leave their source unchanged (that is, are they non-mutating or copies)?
13. **Render:** does `doc.currentRenderer().setParameter("resolution", new Vec2D(...))` take effect? Does the `doc.render(path)` format follow the extension (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.tiff`)?
14. **Undo:** does `recordGeometryForUndo()` work from a Macro (docs say Tool only), and does Undo then restore the mesh without crashing?
15. **`normalType`/`normalAngle` on polygon scripts:** are they host parameters, or only present when the script declares them (as GrapherUV does)?
16. **Native method gaps:** do `node.id()`, `File.readInt()`, `Particle.setDeath()`, `doc.selectedObjects(true)`, `Vec4D.isEqual()` and `Material.rib()` exist?
17. **Winding:** with `addPolygon`/`addIndexPolygon`, which corner order faces outward? (Build one quad and check its normal display.)
18. **Rotation axes:** confirm pitch is around X and bank around Z.
19. **Expression tags:**
    - Does `getParameter("rotation", t)` return the F-curve value rather than the value the expression last wrote?
    - Can a tag have working buttons?
    - Is a tag's own `setParameter(..., false)` safe inside `performExpression`?
20. **Undo:** does `recordParametersForUndo()` on N objects in one Tool action make one Undo step or N?
21. **New scripts:** does "Update Scripts Menu" exist in 8.x, or is a relaunch needed? The book says relaunch.
