Boolean Cut.js

Hello

It's a tool script to cut polygon object with spline path. Only v7+.
Internally this uses Boolean modifier to cut.

updated 20170127: fixed closed spline cut bug with b20.

Best.

Thanks.

Another great one. :icon_thumbup: 
Unfortunately I can´t get this to run: I got either to "untouched" meshes in the xyz_cut-folder or it is empty. I watched the demo video quite carefully.
1. Place polygon object
2. Place spline in front (Y-axis)
3. Select polygon object
4. call Boolean_cut tool script
5. drag spline to entry field in script
6. hit "apply" button
7. result is an empty folder or two identical uncut base mesh objects.

Anything I´m doing wrong here?

Cheers
Frank

It worked for me I had to drag them from the old object.
update did not work with the star spline.

This simple case works here too.
But if I take a sphere and a flower spline I receive an empty "Ball_cut"-folder.

Hi

thank you for testing it.  

cut path should be z axis of spline object, not x nor y. please send me the file to look into it.

Sorry for the confusion; X-axis was a typing error. I used Z-Axis all the time.
Here´s a super simple file which generates just an empty folder. (I had a much more complex set-up in mind).
Thanks for your time.

Cheers
Frank

Hi Hiroto.
Thanks for the fix. It works now.
I found another error-prone one when cutting a thickened relief object. I´ve sent you an example file via email because it´s too large for an upload.
Thanks again for your awesome scripts.

Cheers
Frank
