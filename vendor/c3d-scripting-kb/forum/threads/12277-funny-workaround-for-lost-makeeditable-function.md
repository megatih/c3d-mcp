Funny workaround for lost "makeEditable" function

Run Automator app and type this simple Javascript:

	
	


```
var se = Application('System Events');
var c3d = Application('Cheetah3D.app'); //mine is 'Cheetah3D 7-20.app'
c3d.activate();
delay(0.2)
se.keystroke('c', { using: [ 'option down', 'command down' ] });
```


save it to /somwhere/makeeditable.app. Mine is in ~/Library/Application Support/Cheetah3D/Scripts/Tool/makeeditable.app

then after all (recommend at the end of your script):

	
	


```
doc.selectObject(your_modifer_object, false);
OS.system("open ~/Library/[B]'[/B]Application Support[B]'[/B]/Cheetah3D/Scripts/Tool/makeeditable.app");
```
