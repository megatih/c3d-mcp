The file path with double byte character would fail to open.

Hi,

I'm having trouble with opening file that has Japanese character in the file path. 

somthing like:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
myfile = new File("~/Desktop/???.mqo"); // fine at this moment.
myfile.open(READ_MODE); // fails at this point.
OS.messageBox("Check", myfile.isOpen()); // returns false.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I rename my file to 'test.mqo' and do the same again:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
myfile = new File("~/Desktop/test.mqo"); // fine at this moment.
myfile.open(READ_MODE); // good at this point.
OS.messageBox("Check", myfile.isOpen()); // returns true.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, at this point the ONLY problem with 2 bytes character is to 'open()' method.  In the other part, the Cheetah3d handles fine with double byte character like texture path.( tested in UI and reads texture correctly with 2 bytes path.):

So far, I do rename my file and folder name to ascii character to import from script, but it would be great if 'Open()' support the path with 2 bytes path. 

Thanks,

Hi,
script files must be always saved in ASCII format. C/C++ etc. also don't allow 2-bytes characters in source code. I guess the Javascript engine does the same.

Hi,

Thanks for your repliy.
Ok, I understand that the script must be in ascii.
So since that, I make temporary file using copyTo() and then open my ascii renamed file and removing it when I done with reading.

myfile = new File(path);
tmpPath = myfile.directory()+"/tmp"+(new Date()).getTime();
var isOK = myfile.copyTo( tmpPath );
...
..
.

I hope copyTo() won't get too much time when the file size is big...

Thankyou,
