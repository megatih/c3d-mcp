Sound Loader.js - v7+ only

Hello,

It's a polygon script to load sound data as f-curve parameters. it's available for Cheetah3D v7+.

http://tres-graficos.jp/blog/files/article.php?id=119

you can load various sound format ( "aac", "ac3", "aif", "aiff", "aifc", "caf", "mp3", "mp4", "m4a", "wav", "mov" ).

resolution: resolution count in 1 sec.
sound left: left sound
sound right: right sound ( if it's mono, it will be 0 )
sound wave: custom f-curve value for control

[UPDATE] 20170401: sound file path escape bug fixed.

Best

tg_jp, Hiroto

Hi,

Thank you for your testing.

Which OS version of your Mac? ( this script works 10.7+ )

Can you show me console log when you use it from Cheetah3D?

Best.

Hi,

thank you for reporting.

1. please try to run helper binary (Sound Helper Loader) with double clicking.
2. after clicking, Terminal.app will be opened, and show some messages, then quit.

if you see different messages, it doesn't work correctly. maybe some permission missing on 10.12.x.

Hi Hiroto,

Attempted correcting launch permissions via Gatekeeper, Firewall(added Sound Loader Helper & C3D to Advanced settings "allow all incoming connections"), added to the Sound Loader Helper executable Get info owners to run as system admin but still fail to import any audio into C3D.

I've noticed when launching into Terminal there is a directory listed that's not available on my MBP, that reads:

"sound: ~/Desktop/soundFiles/dog.mp3, data: /tmp/soundLoader.data"

It appears to be a directory from your workstation that's looking for a dog.mp3 & temp data from the drives hidden tmp folder called soundLoader.data...
Last effort I attempted to fool the sound loader by renaming an mp3 as "dog.mp3" in hopes that it would self correct it's internal cache but no win there either.

So how do I correct it on my end so the Sound Loader Helper unix executable can open without looking for those files without disabling Gatekeeper?

<https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12343/post-106658>

Hi,

thank you for reporting.

dog.mp3 is not required, that file will be loaded just in case standalone mode ( directly clicking Sound Loader Helper excecutables ).

How about logs on Console.log app when script loads sound file on Cheetah3D?

Pretty sure you put the script in the wrong place.
I believe it still works as it loads sound files - but as soon as I enable the f-Curve-controller tag script Cheetah3d crashes instantly every time.
So maybe Hiroto might want to have a look into it.

Not sure how I can help any further as I got it running after updating to that latest version. If you´re on Mojave already it´s maybe about the "permission thing" Hiroto mentioned in his reply N°6.

Hi! This is (potentially) such an awesome tool, but I don't get the basic workflow. Sorry. Can someone please just give a quick rundown of the steps to make this work. And also any other limitations (length of sound, etc) For me nothing is happening - but hope it will someday! : )

<https://www.cheetah3d.com/forum/index.php?threads/12343/post-115206>

In essence you put the two scripts (Sound Loader Helper, Sound Loader.js) in to the Polygonobj-folder and need the additional F-Curve Controller tag script.
Call the Sound Loader script from Tools->Script->Polygon Script and load a sound file via "load".
Add the F-Curve Controller tag script to the sound loader from Tools->Script->Tag Script.
Now one can tell how the wave form (now f-curves) should modify the target object via different available parameters - in the end you´ ll bake the f-curve data to the target object and have an animated object driven by sound. That´s the theory.
I can´ t get it to run right now and my file from Nov. last year didn´ t seem to work anymore.
So I´ m a bit clueless how to get this workflow to run properly.

Cheers
Frank

Hi Frank I wanted to have some music in my animation file to sync the guitar players hands to the music as a guide. I  installed the Sound loader helper and sound loader.js as told. I have the sound file loaded (I see it in the F curve editor.) I don't hear anything when I hit play. any idea why?

As far as I know Cheetah3D don´t support sound otherwise I would expect that movie textures contain the sound channel in rendered animation movie file which is not the case.

Had the same issue try playing from the very start or scrubbing the timeline a bit. Also check if audio is muted in the settings.
