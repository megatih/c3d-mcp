Hi Hiroto,
just saw your BVH exporter is available. It's a absolute must have script for all v6 users. Thank you very much for writing it.:smile:

I tried placing the script in the scripts folder, but it does not show up in the script drop-down menu.

What have I done wrong?  Brand new to Cheetah 3D, but I will definitely want to create characters and then animate them with motion capture files.

My goal is to make characters and levels for Unity3D with Cheetah3D.

Hi Mike and Welcome!
The script is a tool-script so it needs to be inside that Tool-folder and Cheetah3d needs a restart after installing scripts.

Cheers
Frank

I bought Cheetah 3D from the app store.  I'm not sure if that matters, but there is no other directories for Cheetah 3D.  If I right-click on the Cheetah3D icon under FINDER -> APPLICATIONS and choose 'Show Package Contents' - everything is in there.  Under the RESOURCES -> PLUGINS -> SCRIPTS folder, I copied your script to the TOOLS subfolder and restarted C3D.  Still does not show up.

What am I doing wrong?

Mike

The path is:
Mac/HD~/Library/Application Support/Cheetah3d/Scripts/Tool
Don´t manipulated the app-content as it may cause damage to the license (GateKeeper).

I have no Cheetah3D folder where you describe:

My users directory also does not have a Cheetah3D folder:

There is no Cheetah3D folder.  It is only in the Applications folder:

I bought Cheetah3D using the App Store.  This is how it installed it.

Yes, I immediately knew how to run a script.  I honestly am not that dumb - it was fairly obvious, but I read that help subject anyway.  There is obviously something very wrong with my install, which was 100% automatic off the App Store and I have no idea how to fix it.

I am getting frustrated.

I´m not sure how the Cheetah3d-MAS install looks look as I don´t have this version - but the place you´re looking up seems obviously the wrong one. Here it is again:
Mac/HD~/Library/Application Support/Cheetah3d/Scripts/Tool

When there are no such folders you might create these:
But I doubt it´s totally empty.

I am certain your install is correct.
Mavericks HIDES the Library folder by default.

Check this link to discover how to make visible.

Also - you can do this from the Finder/Desktop:
Click on "Go"
Select "Go to Folder"
then input: "~/Library/Application Support/Cheetah3D/"
This will get you to the right Directory.

Cheers.

Thank you.  I know how to do this in Windows but did not realize it needed to be done in Mac as well.  That makes total sense now.

How do I attach the new bvh- files to my existing skeleton?
I'm unable to figure it out...

Hi, thank you for your comment.

1. select root object at object browser.
2. click 'attach motion' button

Best.
